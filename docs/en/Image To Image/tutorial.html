    <h2>Guide to Using the Image to Image Feature</h2>
    <p>The Image to Image feature in AiCasso is a cool way to take an image you already have and transform it into something new. It's like giving your picture a makeover based on your own description!</p>

    <h3>How It Works:</h3>
    
<div class="example">
    <strong>Input Image:</strong>
    <div class="result">
        <img src="../../images/tutorials/Image to Image/input.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Input Image">
    </div>
    <strong>Prompt 1:</strong>
    <p>"A cute dog, use half the strength"</p>
    <strong>Result 1:</strong>
    <div class="result">
        <img src="../../images/tutorials/Image to Image/cutedog.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Result 1">
    </div>
    <strong>Prompt 2:</strong>
    <p>"A cute 3D CGI kind of cat with big eyes, use 90% strength, and use the 3D cartoon style"</p>
    <strong>Result 2:</strong>
    <div class="result">
        <img src="../../images/tutorials/Image to Image/3dcgicat.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Result 2">
    </div>
    <strong>Prompt 3:</strong>
    <p>"A black cat, make it realistic"</p>
    <strong>Result 3:</strong>
    <div class="result">

    </div>
</div>

    <h3>Optional Parameters</h3>
    <p>If you want to add your own twist to the image transformation, here are some optional settings you can play around with. But don't worry—if you just want to describe what you want, AiCasso will get the job done without needing any of these extras!</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Negative Prompt:</strong> If there's something specific you <em>don’t</em> want in your new image, you can mention it here. But if you leave it blank, that's fine too!</li>
        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> This controls how much of the original image is used. You can go from 0.1 to 1.0. The lower the number, the more your image will keep its original look. The default is 0.5, which is a nice balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance Style:</strong> Want to give your image a specific vibe? Choose a style like comic, chibi, 3D, anime, or realistic. The default is realistic, but feel free to explore!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And hey, remember, you don’t have to worry about getting everything perfect. Just describe what you want in your own words, and AiCasso will do the rest. Have fun creating!</p>
