    <h2>Guide to Using the Relighting Feature</h2>
    <p>The Relighting feature in AiCasso is super cool! It lets you change the lighting in your images with just a few words. Want the sun in the back or a soft light from the side? No problem! Just describe it, and AiCasso will handle the rest.</p>

    <h3>How It Works:</h3>
    
    <div class="example">
        <strong>Input Image:</strong>
        <div class="result">
            <img src="../../images/tutorials/relighting/input.jpg" alt="Input Image" loading="lazy">
        </div>
        <strong>Prompt Used:</strong>
        <p>"Make it so that the sun is in the back"</p>
        <strong>Result:</strong>
        <div class="result">
            <img src="../../images/tutorials/relighting/result.jpg" alt="Relighting Result" loading="lazy">
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Optional Tweaks</h3>
    <p>If you're feeling adventurous and want to add a bit more flair to your relighting, here are some things you can tweak:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Negative Prompt:</strong> Want to avoid something? You can tell AiCasso what <em>not</em> to include. But don’t worry, if you leave this blank, AiCasso will just focus on what you do want.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting Direction:</strong> You can specify where the light should come from—left, right, top, bottom, or even none at all. By default, the light comes from the left.</li>
        <li><strong>Guidance Scale:</strong> This helps AiCasso stick to your description. The scale goes from 1 to 20, with 7 being the default. The higher the number, the more AiCasso sticks to your prompt.</li>
        <li><strong>High-Resolution Scale:</strong> Want your image to pop? This controls the clarity. The default is 1.5, but you can set it from 1.0 to 2.0 for a crispier image.</li>
        <li><strong>Denoise Levels:</strong> There are two levels—low-resolution and high-resolution. These control how smooth or detailed the final image looks. You can set the low-res denoise level between 0.0 and 1.0 (default is 0.9) and the high-res between 0.0 and 1.0 (default is 0.5).</li>
        <li><strong>Number of Steps:</strong> This is how many steps AiCasso takes to polish your image. The default is 50, but you can go from 20 to 50 steps.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, these tweaks are totally optional! AiCasso is pretty good at figuring out what you want, so just describe your vision in your own words, and it’ll do the magic. No need to be perfect with grammar or details—just have fun and see what you can create!</p>
